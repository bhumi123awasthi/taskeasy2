# TaskEasy UI - Pixel-like Replica

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold that replicates the provided screenshot layout.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The project uses Tailwind CSS. After installing, the dev server will run (default Vite port).

Note: This is a handcrafted pixel-like replica; tweak spacing/colors in `src/index.css` and `src/App.jsx` for further adjustments.
